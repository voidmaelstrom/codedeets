App to support collaboration with many peeps on code and other related interests

## App Summary

This project is a small app meant for developers to collaborate on ideas and provide
informative posts on how to solve problems. The main reason for the app is to allow
a central resource for developers and up-and-coming coders to share resources and
information. Posts allow for a `.md` file to be uploaded that has useful info within
similar to README.md files in Github.

File uploads are restricted to `.md` types only and are tied to posts that only
authenticated (logged-in) users can create.
